# L1.1_leetcode-prize-distribution
This repository contains an analysis of LeetCode’s prize distribution structure used in its coding contests. The project includes a detailed breakdown of how the prizes are awarded based on ranks, and how game theory principles and mathematical modeling can explain the incentives behind LeetCode’s distribution strategy.
Included are:

A Python program that models the prize distribution curve using exponential decay.
Graphs and visualizations that demonstrate the curve and its fitting to the prize data.
A deeper exploration of how this model balances competitiveness and inclusivity in LeetCode contests.
This project aims to provide insights into the LeetCode contest structure, helping participants understand how rewards are distributed and how effort maximization aligns with game theory principles.
